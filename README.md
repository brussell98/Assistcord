## AutoDiscord Alpha

### Author: brussell98

------

To do before beta release

- [x] Make login appear first and then change to actual stuff on login
- [x] Custom status entry
- [x] Keep updating every 2 minutes to make sure it stays that
- [x] What I'm watching
- [x] Make it look nice
- [x] Clear status
- [ ] Lost connection handled

To do after beta release

- [ ] Add help/info section
- [ ] Add Automation module
- [ ] Dark theme
- [ ] Settings -- *through right-click for now*
- [ ] eval command (`*eval bot.servers.length`)
- [ ] replace command (maybe `*show>should` would replace "show" in the previous message with "should")
- [ ] Stats command (`*stats`)
- [ ] Match exact modifier for autos (`e*`)
- [ ] All of those above can be changed in settings
- [ ] Simple delete command (`*delete 12`)
- [ ] Encrypt passwords so they're at least not plain text
- [ ] Log usernames so you can check detected past usernames (`*names @Brussell`)

Bugs

- [x] Replace `"` in the auto's input values with `&quot;` so it works
